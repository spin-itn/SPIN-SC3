# SPIN-SC3

SPIN Short Course 3 -- Interrogating the Restless Earth
Material for the practicals during the [SPIN short course on inverse theory](https://spin-itn.eu/sc3/).

## Linear / Linearized Inversion

By [Andreas Fichtner](https://github.com/afichtner).

## Machine Learning for Seismology

By [LÃ©onard Seydoux](https://github.com/leonard-seydoux).

## Technical requirements and setup

For information about the technical requirements to run the practicals, see the [README](machine-learning/README.md) in the [machine-learning](./machine-learning/) directory first for installation instructions. Then, please check that you have the necessary packages for the [`inverse-theory`](./inverse-theory/) practicals as well, see  [README](https://github.com/spin-itn/SPIN-SC3/blob/main/inverse-theory/readme.md).
