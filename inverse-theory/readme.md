# Inverse Theory

This directory contains lecture notes, PowerPoint slides and Jupyter notebooks for the short course on Inverse Theory. 

The content of the lectures is largely based on a preliminary version of an Inverse Theory book that I have been writing over the past couple of years. Needless to say that only a small fraction of the book can be covered in the 1.5 days of the workshop, but it should still be a useful resource for those who want to know more. The pdf can be downloaded here (ca. 50 MB): [Lecture Notes on Inverse Theory](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5263r81u8h1f8yh/Inverse_Theory.pdf?dl=0)

The lectures themselves will be followed by a series of computer exercises. No worries! There is no need to actually write code yourself in the short amount of time that we have available. Instead, you will have the opportunity to run a collection of Jupyter notebooks that are mostly intended to illustrate basic concepts and algorithms. To run the notebooks, make sure you can open Jupyter notebooks and run programs written in Python 3. For installation instructions, please consider the excellent README of the machine learning part of the short course, written by Leonard Seydoux.

The notebooks are deliberately simplistic, and the required Python packages should be included in any standard Python distribution. Still, for completeness, they are listed here:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- csv
- numba
- mpl_toolkits
